             that is was the right choice for me. I’ve learnt that organic chemistry
              is purely practice, which I didn’t know before university. </p>

       				<p>I’m most looking forward to summer, seeing my housemate + italy,
                my year abroad next year, Singapore from august to may - chemistry,
                challenge and culture shock but I’m very excited. Learning how to
                get by in a different support system. I know one girl going to the
                same uni as me. </p>

         				<p>I’ve never felt discriminated against or outnumbered, however I
                  have noticed it is mainly white people on my course so it lacks
                  diversity, it’s sad because it shows the university system is
                  failing and more support is needed towards minority groups.
                  School of chemistry has supported me well, I have a really academic
                  advisor who checks up on me. Majority of the friends I’ve made is
                  from my course which isn’t the case for a lot of people. I live
                  with girls on my course and it’s the best support system.</p>
