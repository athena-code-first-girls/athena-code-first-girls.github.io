       		<p>I left school with good A-Levels but I didn’t know what I wanted to do after.
            I’ve always been creative and loved making things, but not necessarily in
            the artistic way, I like building things; learning how and why they work.
            At the same time my interest in technology has always been there, ever
            since I first used a computer in primary school. This was in the days
            of Microsoft’s Encarta and I loved it, I couldn’t wait to get to school
            if I knew we were going into the computer room. </p>

       			<p>Life happened, I got married and had a child and I’ve been working in
              offices since I left college, in sales and admin but three years ago I
              had a daughter and decided it was time for change. I want to be inspiring to her, you know?</p>

                suggested that I start with Python, which is what I did.</p>

       				<p>When I feel ready, I hope to be able to join a software company
                as a developer. I’d love to work somewhere that feels like a start-up
                so I can feel the difference I make. But even if that path never works
                out for me, at least I know how to code and I can keep practicing
                on my Raspberry Pi. I’m making a SmartMirror at the moment.</p>
