       			<p> My main area of interest is genetics, and their relation to success
              in endurance sports such as marathon running and cycling. I hope science
              becomes like a long distance run. And by that I mean that on of my friends
              who is a long distance runner once told me that the sport is one of the most
              meritocratic out there. One day you could be racing "Phil" from the pub over
              10 kilometres in Wigan and the next, you're tying your laces next to Mo Farah
              at theÂ start of the Great North Run. There's something inspiring about that
              and I hope more women get into STEM because, like a marathon, the harder
              you work, the better you get. </p>
