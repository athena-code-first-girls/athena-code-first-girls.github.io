       		<p>I looked in Prospectus’ after obtaining my year 12 grades and went
            for Pharmacy. I always wanted to do something in healthcare as I did
            well in my science subjects. I didn’t necessarily want to do a pure
            science subject and I didn’t want to apply for medicine, so I thought
            Pharmacy was a good subject in the middle, combining the healthcare
            and science aspects. </p>

       			<p>We are nurtured very well and each year is different in terms of how
              we are assessed so it allows those who are good at exams to excel as
              well as those who are good at coursework. The ratio of men and women
              on my course is equal, Pharmacy is quite a neutral degree. The support
               system is secure, we have the careers service or university counselling
                - the support from my academic advisor is also very helpful.
                The department of Pharmacy are constantly sending emails for
                opportunities present for us STEM students, which is how I
                have become interested in Law. I’ve recognised how much I
                can do with my degree with the help of University. </p>

       				<p>The happiest period in my life was when I was living at home,
                during secondary school. I had a quiet and relaxed routine which
                included my family. I always look back fondly on this period. My
                inspirations are my mum, dad and sister. My mum and sister are
                very strong and empowered. They give me the strength and give me
                confidence as a person. They are truly high powered, independent
                women. My dad inspires me because he can view situations in a
                different perspective and help me make a balanced decision in my
                life. I appreciate all three of them as they are calm and collected
                people. </p>

       				<p>I’m most looking to graduating, driving and moving back to London.
                I feel like I am ready to move onto the next stage in my life.
                I want to become physically fit and train and eat well. I also
                want to become stronger, more confident. I personally would like
                to also travel abroad myself and tour countries all over the world.
                I personal achievement of mine would be to work in an orphanage.</p>
