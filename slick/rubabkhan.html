  <p> I’m doing dentistry at Plovdiv University in Bulgaria, I was interested in doing it as I come from a medical background and I had the chance to do some work experience prior to studying dentistry. It has a good mix between work life and personal life which is appealing to me. It’s very interesting, I like how hands on it is which keeps me busy and occupied. I have merged with different types of people, some who are not open-minded as me. I’ve learnt to adapt to different types of people. Managing my money, learning how to budget, learning the value and meaning of money, I am very grateful. More men doing dentistry, so women are outnumbered on my course. It’s great women are in medicine in engineering as opposed to men are traditionally the ones working. My experience is really good. My university aren’t very supportive. In european universities, they allow us to be very independent. People doing medicine, have a lot more depth and knowledge, dentist - 2 year course seemed to be more intense, definitely the hardest years of my life. Genuinely the happiest I’ve been is, the course is very stressful and time-consuming, and going to Japan was the most happiest moment. Failing my prosthetic exam, practical based exam, I felt strained, I didn’t have a summer, stress and anxiety. I’m most looking forward to the future, graduate and working and earning, and have my own money and do what i want to do. I hope to enjoy my job and being independent financially. I’m going to barbados in summer. Cooking, I’ve transformed myself from that. I’m really good at cooking with anything in vegetables. Definitely cook more complex dishes including meat. I would really love to meet people from different cultures or learn a language like japanese or korean but I hope to in the future.
