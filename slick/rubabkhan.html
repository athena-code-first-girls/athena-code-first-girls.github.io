       		<p>I’m doing dentistry at Plovdiv University in Bulgaria, I was interested
            in doing it as I come from a medical background and I had the chance to
            do some work experience prior to studying dentistry. It has a good mix
            between work life and personal life which is appealing to me. It’s very
            interesting, I like how hands on it is which keeps me busy and occupied.</p>

       			<p>I have merged with different types of people, some who are not open-minded
              as me. I’ve learnt to adapt to different types of people. Most importantly
              I have learnt how to manage my money, and learn how to budget - learning
              the value and meaning of money. </p>

       				<p>I am very grateful for my position as a woman in STEM. I have found
                that more men are studying dentistry, so women are outnumbered on my
                course. It’s great women that more women are in medicine and engineering
                 as opposed to men who are traditionally seen as the ones working.
                 In european universities, they allow us to be very independent.
                 Overall, my experience is really good even though we (women) are
                 outnumbered. </p>

                enjoy my job and being independent financially. I’m also going to
                Barbados in summer. I also hope to cook more complex dishes which
                include meat. I would really love to meet people from different
                cultures or learn a language like japanese or korean but I hope
                to in the future. </p>
