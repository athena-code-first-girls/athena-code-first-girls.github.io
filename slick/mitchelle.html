  <p>I originally studied Korean at university and had a great time on my year abroad in Seoul.<br>
  But my heart belongs to Science; biology in particular so I'm back studying.<br>
  My main area of interest is genetics, and their relation to success in endurance sport such
  as marathon running and cycling.<br><br> I hope science becomes like a long distance run.<br><br> One
  of my friends who is a long distance runner once told me that the sport is one of the most
  meritocratic out there. One day you could be racing "Phil" from the pub over 10 kilometres in Wigan<br>
  and the next, you're tying your laces next to Mo Farah at the start of the Great North Run. There's something
  inspiring about that and I hope more women get into STEM because, like a marathon, the harder you work,
  the better you get.<br><br><br><br>
