       		<p>I really enjoyed IT lessons at school and loved maths, doing Computer Science at university felt like the best choice for me. During my degree, I had a coding assignment that I really struggled with, but once I experienced the satisfaction of getting that code to work. Well, there was simply no turning back.</p>

       			<p>The honest answer is believing in myself. Once I have gotten over the initial panic of the situation, I break the problem down and begin hacking away at. Until it doesn't feel so overwhelming or seems as impossible as it once did. There are definitely bumps along the way but I dig deep and keep going.</p>

       				<p>I've had quite a few, but the first one that comes to mind was the day I received my degree classification. During the course of my degree, I wanted to give up a number of times but kept pushing and achieved a higher classification than I thought I could.</p>

       				<p>That's a tough one, I have to pick two people. My older sister who is just a BOSS and the perfect example whether its work, family or friends she's shown me the way and set me back on the right track more times than I can count. And Michelle Obama because I can relate with her life (prior to the white house of course) on so many levels. Knowing where she came from and where she is now, the is no limit to what I can achieve.</p>
