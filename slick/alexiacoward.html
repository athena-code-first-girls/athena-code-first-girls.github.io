<p> I got into my last year in school and I knew I wanted to go to University. I went through a stressful week of changing my course four times. I was juggling between Law and Medicine, and for these courses there were a lot of pre-university exams and experience I needed that I didn’t have. With Chemistry, I have always enjoyed it in school and it was one of my strongest subjects. My dad always told me to do something I enjoy and this piece of advice really sticks by me today. I have waves when dealing with stress, I consider it this to a struggle. I remember applying to university was a very stressful time. Or when I needed to apply for an Australian visa. I try to not live in the future, I get little things done day by day, for example I was looking forward to being productive today. I’m lucky in Chemistry because the female/male ratio is equal. Out of my friends at home, only one does a STEM subject. My other friends are studious, especially my medic friends. I don’t really have an inspiration, I take inspiration of confident and determined individuals - I believe it’s a good trait to have. For example, some designers such as Anna Wintour. The summer before University was one my happiest times yet. In New York City, I went to the museum of modern art and enjoyed an iced matcha. Afterwards, I picked up a cheesecake walked around the streets. I have a lot of other happy moments such as being with my friends. </p>
