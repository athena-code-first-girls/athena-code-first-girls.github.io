  <p> I left school with good A-Levels but I didn’t know what I wanted to do after.<br><br>
      I’ve always been creative and loved making things, but not necessarily in the artistic way,
      I like building things; learning how and why they work. At the same time my interest in technology
      has always been there, ever since I first used a computer in primary school. This was in the
      days of Microsoft’s Encarta and I loved it, I couldn’t wait to get to school if I knew we were
      going into the computer room.<br><br>
      Life happened, I got married and had a child and I’ve been working in offices since I left college,
      in sales and admin but three years ago I had a daughter and decided it was time for change. I want to
       be inspiring to her, you know?<br><br> I’m a student at the Open University, majoring in Computing and IT Software
      and I also spend time learning to code. A friend suggested that I start with Python, which is what I did.<br><br>
      When I feel ready, I hope to be able to join a software company as a developer. I’d love to work somewhere
       that feels like a start-up so I can feel the difference I make. But even if that path works out for me, at
        least I know how to code and I can keep practicing on my Raspberry Pi. I’m making a SmartMirror at the moment.<br><br><br><br>
