  <p> Chemistry was my favourite subject at A-levels, it has so many options that is was the right choice for me. I’ve learnt that organic chemistry is purely practice, i didn’t know this before university. My great aunt is my inspiration, she’s a really strong independent woman, she’s very hardworking and determined. She’s always travelling and she’s very loving and incredible. A lot of women in my family hold a strong role in my life. Results day was the happiest day of my life, it was such a relief and an achievement at the same time. When my great aunt passed away I really struggled with that, I had counselling and spoke to my personal tutor. I buried myself in work to distract myself/overcome it. I consider myself to be hardworking. I’m most looking forward to summer, seeing my housemate + italy, my year abroad next year, Singapore from august to may - chemistry, challenge and culture shock but I’m very excited. Learning how to get by in a different support system. I know one girl going to the same uni as me. I’ve never felt discriminated against or outnumbered, however I have noticed it is mainly white people on my course so it lacks diversity, it’s sad because it shows the university system is failing and more support is needed towards minority groups.School of chemistry has supported me well, I have a really academic advisor who checks up on me. Majority of the friends I’ve made is from my course which isn’t the case for a lot of people. I live with girls on my course and it’s the best support system.
