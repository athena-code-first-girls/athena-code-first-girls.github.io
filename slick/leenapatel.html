    What are you studying? <br> <br>

  I’m currently studying medicine as I’ve always had an interest for science. Having work experience pre-university at Astrazeneca and Christie care homes helped me realise I really liked the involvement of looking after someone and making a difference. Now when I do clinical experience, visiting the GP or the hospital, I find it really interesting how my knowledge is applied - almost comes together like a jigsaw. The anatomical side of my degree (which very few degrees have the chance to do) allows us to work through each body system per week which I find very unique about my course. <br> <br>

  What is your experience as woman in a STEM based course? <br> <br>

  I have never felt singled out as a woman, for example in consultation skills, sexual health/periods/chest examinations - noticed that men find it more difficult to navigate, and being a woman there is more of an advantage to that part. Fewer females that are consultants. Women are empowered to be in STEM, female directed and oriented subjects, more are encouraged to do engineering, even though it is not 50/50 split, there is a pathway for women towards more traditionally masculine based subjects. I find that my course is a 50/50 split. <br> <br>

  What is the your happiest moment yet? <br> <br>

  I have many significant moments over the past year that make me feel happy. I am most proudest of my self improvement, doing things out of my comfort zones and learning more about philosophy, religion and my own cultural heritage.  This has made me more understanding and empathetic, so I feel more happier with myself. <br> <br>

  Who is your inspiration? <br> <br>

  I do not have one specific inspiration, I value different traits from people: I want to be as strong and outspoken as Serena Williams, charismatic as Alan Waters and as courageous as Amelia Howards. What inspires me the most is that they broke through the essential glass ceiling, I like people who have set their own president, who question everything and have formed their own opinion. It’s very easy to go along with the flow and so I like women who can make their own decision and have faith in what they do. <br> <br>

  How do you overcome a struggle? <br> <br>

  Life will always find something to put you down and hit rock bottom, the most important thing is about how you overcome it. Some people bury themselves in work or find a new motivation in life. But it makes people stronger once they come out of it. <br> <br>

  What are you most looking forward to? <br> <br>

  This summer I am going to Uganda, and participating in their culture and healthcare. I have never travelled anywhere in Africa and I hope it is a life changing experience. I am really looking forward to my speciality as I am quite indecisive right now. I want to become someone who is more sociable, and in the past year I have been learning Spanish and I want to continue that to the next level. Finally, I want to have a lot more experiences such as skydiving and bungee jumping.
