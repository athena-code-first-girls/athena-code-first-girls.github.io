       		<p>I’m currently studying medicine as I’ve always had an interest for
            science. Having work experience pre-university at Astrazeneca and
            Christie care homes helped me realise I really liked the involvement
            of looking after someone and making a difference. Now when I
            do clinical experience, visiting the GP or the hospital, I find it
            really interesting how my knowledge is applied - almost comes together
            like a jigsaw. The anatomical side of my degree (which very few degrees
            have the chance to do) allows us to work through each body system per
            week which I find very unique about my course. </p>

       			<p> I have never felt singled out as a woman, for example in consultation
              skills, sexual health/periods/chest examinations - noticed that men find
              it more difficult to navigate, and being a woman there is more of an
              advantage to that part. Fewer females that are consultants. Women are
              empowered to be in STEM, female directed and oriented subjects, more
              are encouraged to do engineering, even though it is not 50/50 split,
              there is a pathway for women towards more traditionally masculine
              based subjects. I find that my course is a 50/50 split. </p>

       				<p>I have many significant moments over the past year that make me
                feel happy. I am most proudest of my self improvement, doing things
                 out of my comfort zones and learning more about philosophy, religion
                  and my own cultural heritage.  This has made me more understanding
                  and empathetic, so I feel more happier with myself. </p>

       				<p>I do not have one specific inspiration, I value different traits
                from people: I want to be as strong and outspoken as Serena
                Williams, charismatic as Alan Waters and as courageous as Amelia
                Howards. What inspires me the most is that they broke through
                the essential glass ceiling, I like people who have set their own
                president, who question everything and have formed their own opinion.
                It’s very easy to go along with the flow and so I like women who can
                make their own decision and have faith in what they do.</p>

                  <p>This summer I am going to Uganda, and participating in their
                    culture and healthcare. I have never travelled anywhere in
                    Africa and I hope it is a life changing experience. I am really
                    looking forward to my speciality as I am quite indecisive right
                    now. I want to become someone who is more sociable, and in the
                    past year I have been learning Spanish and I want to continue
                    that to the next level. Finally, I want to have a lot more
                    experiences such as skydiving and bungee jumping.</p>
