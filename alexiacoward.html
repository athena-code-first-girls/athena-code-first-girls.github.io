       		<p>I got into my last year in school and I knew I wanted to go to University.
            I went through a stressful week of changing my course four times. I was
            juggling between Law and Medicine, and for these courses there were a lot
            of pre-university exams and experience I needed that I didn’t have. With
            Chemistry, I have always enjoyed it in school and it was one of my strongest
             subjects. My dad always told me to do something I enjoy and this piece of
             advice really sticks by me today. I am now in my 2nd year at the University
             of Manchester studying Chemistry.</p>

       			<p>I have waves when dealing with stress, I consider it this to a struggle.
               I remember applying to university was a very stressful time. Or when
               I needed to apply for an Australian visa. I try to not live in the
               future, I get little things done day by day, for example I was looking
               forward to being productive today. </p>

         				<p>The summer before University was one my happiest times yet.
                  In New York City, I went to the museum of modern art and enjoyed
                  an iced matcha. Afterwards, I picked up a cheesecake walked around
                  the streets. I have a lot of other happy moments such as being
                  with my friends.  </p>
